# From Zero Issues

## Welcome to the From Zero Issues tracking repo.

<p>Our main repo for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fromzero.com">From Zero!</a> is private for the moment as the git history contains sensitive information related to site operations.</p>
<p>We have created this repo to publicly display what issues have been reported by our users, or what we may already be working on!</p>

## About
<p>We ask that you please do not use <code>Issues</code> or <code>Pull Requests</code> (unless you're making this readme prettier).</p>
<p>This repo will <strong>not</strong> be used for anything other than <code>Discussions</code>.</p>
<p>For reference, our frontend uses React 17 and TypeScript, and our backend uses JavaScript. We do not intend to switch frameworks at this time.</p>

## Guidelines

<p>Please look through the discussions board of the relevant topic for your post by using the label or filters feature to see if someone else has posted about it already.</p>
<p>Duplicates are welcome, but it's better if the board isn't cluttered with multiple posts of the same topic, as well as making it easier to see at a glance how many people are affected by an issue or would like to see a new/improved feature.</p>
<p><strong>Constructive</strong> criticism of the website is welcome, but if you are rude or abrasive in your post/replies it will be ignored or deleted and you risk not being allowed to continue posting.</p>

## Before Posting
<p>If the issue is related to your sensitive account information or billing please reach out to us directly via Discord or email rather than making a post.</p>
<p>You may include links to screenshots or screen recordings hosted on Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. in your posts if you can't be bothered to figure out how to embed them in the post itself.<br /><strong>Make sure their visibility/sharing is set to public so we can see them!</strong></p>
<p>If you are reporting a piracy concern with our books, please send a DM including a link to the host site to Melanie#2745 on Discord and she will handle it.</p>
<br>
<p>Please use the appropriate category for your post, and include in your post the following for each type:</p>

### Issue Reports

  <li>If the issue is triggered by specific actions, the steps we can take to reproduce it.</li>
  <li>Whether or not the issue persists through relogging, page refreshes, and/or hard-refreshes (Windows: <code>shift + F5</code> / MacOS <code>command + shift + R</code>).</li>
